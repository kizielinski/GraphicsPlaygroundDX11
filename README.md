# Graphics Playground DirectX

This repo is where my DirectX11 and DirectX12 projects live
They are an extension of a smaller school project I started in college.
I now extend them with new features and often refactor older code
to production level standards when necessary.

My current DirectX11 Projects are: 

- LightRendering Application

My current DirectX12 Projects are:

- 3D Math Calculator

DirectX11 Project Features:

- Camera System
- Indirect Lighting
- Refraction
- Point, Spot, and Directional Lights
- Particles
- ImGUI UI Implementation
- FIle Input support for Models and Textures

DirectX Project Planned Features:
- Shadows
- Scene Saving
- UI Implementation for Lights

DirectX12 Project Features:

- Basic Rendering

DirectX12 Project Planned Features:

- Line Rendering for Vectors
- Able to compute various 3D math computations
- ImGUI implementation for Calculator Input

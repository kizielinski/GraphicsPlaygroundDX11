Changelog 9/20/2021

Added: Renderer Class

Class works, need to implement dynamic light count next, that's the only thing not currently adjustable in my scene.

Need to fix assimp library installation, pulled out for now due to Linker errors.

There is a memory leak somewhere, missing a delete keywords on Entities I believe, not sure where though. 

Game::Draw only has one line: currenderRender->Render(...) yay!

Fixed my model .objs being ignored in my git repo so if should be good to pull from now! 

Submission #4

Have a great night!

To Do List for Advancd GGP

Work on Renderer
Make an Asset Manager
Clean up importing using the new assimp library added to the project
Make (Draggable or somethign) Gui for Transformations
Add the ability to Add/Remove Lights (separate Gui window from objects? I think yes)
Figure out a way to clean up EntityWindow's ridiculous amount of back and forth with Game.cpp. Possible solution could be a shared datastruct with all the bool(confirmation) values for each UI action.
